Nearist greatly accelerates big data searches through a revolutionary new hardware platform specifically engineered to handle the computationally demanding task of performing Nearest Neighbor Search on vector representations of contentâ€”enabling your search routines to deliver results several orders of magnitude faster than anything else on the market.

##Structure
This repository contains the tool required to program the 21 Distance Calculation Engines (DCEs) via the host instead of JTAG. for more information about the DCE see the !!!vsx-core-dce repository!!! 
spi_cfg hooks onto the VSX spi programming device files. 
##Build
Run CMake
  `cmake CMakeLists.txt`
Run make
  `make`
spi_cfg executable will be in './bin'
